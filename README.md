### What I learned
One of the takeaway from this project was mastering responsive design principles, particularly using html meta name, CSS custom properties and media queries to ensure the QR code component remains functional and aesthetically pleasing across different device sizes.
```html
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```css
@media screen {
    body{
        max-width: 375px;
    }
}
```

### Continued development
-The next steps include further refining responsive designs and exploring more complex layouts with Flexbox. The goal is to build more interactive and visually appealing components that can adapt to various devices and screen sizes.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts - Outfit]('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@100..900&display=swap') - This helped me aquire the font needed for the project.
